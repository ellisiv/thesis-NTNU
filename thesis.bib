The interface between the two fluids is considered to be sharp and is described as the zero level set of a smooth function. We use a second-order projection method which implements a second-order upwinded procedure for differencing the convection terms. A new treatment of the level set method allows us to include large density and viscosity ratios as well as surface tension. We consider the motion of air bubbles in water and falling water drops in air.}

abstract = {A constrained optimization type of numerical algorithm for removing noise from images is presented. The total variation of the image is minimized subject to constraints involving the statistics of the noise. The constraints are imposed using Lanrange multipliers. The solution is obtained using the gradient-projection method. This amounts to solving a time dependent partial differential equation on a manifold determined by the constraints. As t → ∞ the solution converges to a steady state which is the denoised image. The numerical algorithm is simple and relatively fast. The results appear to be state-of-the-art for very noisy images. The method is noninvasive, yielding sharp edges in the image. The technique could be interpreted as a first step of moving each level set of the image normal to itself with velocity equal to the curvature of the level set divided by the magnitude of the gradient of the image, and a second step which projects the image back onto the constraint set.}

abstract = {A coupled level set method for the motion of multiple junctions (of, e.g., solid, liquid, and grain boundaries), which follows the gradient flow for an energy functional consisting of surface tension (proportional to length) and bulk energies (proportional to area), is developed. The approach combines the level set method of S. Osher and J. A. Sethian with a theoretical variational formulation of the motion by F. Reitich and H. M. Soner. The resulting method uses as many level set functions as there are regions and the energy functional is evaluated entirely in terms of level set functions. The gradient projection method leads to a coupled system of perturbed (by curvature terms) Hamilton–Jacobi equations. The coupling is enforced using a single Lagrange multiplier associated with a constraint which essentially prevents (a) regions from overlapping and (b) the development of a vacuum. The numerical implementation is relatively simple and the results agree with (and go beyond) the theory as given in [12]. Other applications of this methodology, including the decomposition of a domain into subregions with minimal interface length, are discussed. Finally, some new techniques and results in level set methodology are presented.}

abstract="This work addresses the problem of surface reconstruction from unorganized points and normals that are acquired from laser scanning of 3D objects. We propose a novel technique for implicit surface reconstruction that effectively combines the trend setting method known as Multi-level Partition of the Unity (MPU) with the Gaussian Process Regression. The reconstructed implicit surface is obtained by subdividing the domain into a set of smaller sub-domains using the MPU algorithm, in each sub-domain a Gaussian Process Regression is carried out that provides accurate local approximations which are blended to obtain a global representation corresponding to the reconstructed implicit surface. The proposed algorithm is able to deal efficiently with point clouds presenting several features such as complex topology and geometry, missing regions and very low sampling rate. Moreover, we conduct some experiments with several acquired data and perform some comparisons with state of the art techniques showing competitive results.",
