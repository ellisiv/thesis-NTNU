\chapter*{Preface}
This master thesis marks the end of my five years at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and completes my degree in applied mathematics. The work has been done in close collaboration with my supervisor at the Department of Mathematical Sciences, Anne Kværnø, together with her colleague from the University of Lund, Claus Führer and their Ph.D students Samson Seifu and Alemayehu Adugna.

First of all, I want to thank Professor Anne Kværnø for taking me in on short notice and giving me an interesting topic. She has been a motivator, discussion partner, and a great supervisor this semester, and I could not ask for anyone better. I also want to thank the rest of the team working with me on this project. For your sense of humor, our enjoyable Friday meetings, and valuable feedback and discussions. It has been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you luck with your further work and collaboration.

Most importantly, I would like to thank my family, friends, and partner for supporting me and being patient with me when I have been focused on my studies---not only this semester but all my five years of study. I also want to give special thanks to my classmates, who have given me invaluable motivation and companionship. I did not do this alone.
