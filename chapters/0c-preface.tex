\chapter*{Preface}
First of all, I want to thank Professor Anne Kværnø for taking me in on short notice and giving me an interesting topic. She has been a motivator, discussion partner and a great supervisor this semester, and I could not ask for anyone better.

I also want to thank the team that has been working with me on this project, Professor Claus Führer and Ph.D students Samson Seifu and Alemayehu Adugna for your sense of humor, our enjoyable Friday meetings and valueable feedback and discussions. It has been a pleasure working with you, and I wish you luck for your further work on this project.

Finally, I would like to thank my family, friends and partner for supporting me and being patient with me when I have been focused on my studies - not only this semester, but also during my last five years. I also want to give a special thanks to my classmates, who has given me invaluable motivation and companionship. I could not have done this alone.
