Why is it not so smart to find distance function to the iso-contour and multiply with sign-function?
In that case we must find the actual contourline explicitly. In the case of plt.contour, we only have 
points or line segments, which means that we loose information. We linearise the contour and thus, we change the zero iso-contour which we do not want.
